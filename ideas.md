  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Swiss Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Honesty**: Expose the grid, use high contrast, and avoid hiding the structure.
  2. **Function Over Form**: The device is a tool; the website should feel like a manual or a blueprint.
  3. **Bold Typography**: Large, impactful headings that demand attention.
  4. **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with the specific LED colors (green, yellow, red, purple) as the only accents.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) or very light grey (#F5F5F5).
  - **Text**: Jet Black (#000000) for maximum readability.
  - **Accents**: The specific LED colors (Green #10B981, Yellow #F59E0B, Red #EF4444, Purple #8B5CF6) used sparingly but effectively to highlight key features.
  - **Intent**: To mirror the "no distractions" philosophy of the product. The design is direct, unadorned, and focused.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Use a visible or implied grid but break it intentionally.
  - **Split Screens**: Vertical dividers separating text from imagery.
  - **Sticky Elements**: The "Reserve Now" button or key specs sticking to corners or edges.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: 2px-4px black borders around images and sections.
  - **Monospace Fonts**: For technical specs and data points, reinforcing the "engineering" aspect.
  - **Raw Product Shots**: Images placed without heavy shadows or reflections, perhaps with "cutout" look.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover States**: Sharp changes (invert colors, offset movement) rather than smooth fades.
  - **Scroll**: Snappy, section-based scrolling or parallax effects that feel mechanical.

  **Animation**:
  - **Instant Transitions**: No ease-in-out; things appear or slide in linearly.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for "Focus", "Deep Work", "Presence".

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Chakra Petch' (Bold, Uppercase).
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto Mono' for a technical feel.

  **Design Movement**: Soft Minimalism / Ethereal Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Calm Focus**: The website should induce the state of flow the product promises.
  2. **Light & Shadow**: Use soft, diffused light to mimic the LED ring's glow.
  3. **Fluidity**: Elements should flow into each other without hard edges.
  4. **Human-Centric**: Focus on the feeling of relief and focus, not just the hardware.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Very dark charcoal (#111827) or deep purple (#1E1B4B) to represent "deep work" mode.
  - **Text**: Off-white (#F3F4F6) for reduced eye strain.
  - **Accents**: Glowing gradients of the LED colors (Teal, Purple, Amber) acting as light sources in the dark UI.
  - **Intent**: To create an immersive, "night mode" atmosphere that appeals to developers and creatives who work late.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Central Axis**: Content flowing down a central line but branching out organically.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Images and text overlapping slightly with glassmorphism effects.
  - **Full-Screen Visuals**: Large, immersive product shots that fade into the background.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glow Effects**: Buttons and key elements emitting a soft light.
  - **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass panels for cards and navigation.
  - **Gradient Borders**: Subtle gradients on borders to suggest illumination.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smoothness**: Everything floats and glides.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A subtle spotlight following the cursor to reveal content.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Fades**: Elements gently fading in and moving up.
  - **Breathing**: Subtle pulsing of the "glow" elements to mimic a calm breath.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (Light to Medium weights).
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Satoshi' (Clean, legible).

  **Design Movement**: Modern Industrial / Apple-esque
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Product Hero**: The device is the absolute star; the design recedes to let it shine.
  2. **Precision**: Pixel-perfect alignment, balanced whitespace, and refined typography.
  3. **Storytelling**: A linear narrative that guides the user from problem to solution.
  4. **Premium Feel**: High-end aesthetics to justify the product's value.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Light Gray (#F9FAFB) to White (#FFFFFF).
  - **Text**: Dark Slate (#1F2937) and Cool Gray (#4B5563).
  - **Accents**: The product's own LED colors, plus a signature "Blurple" (#667EEA) for primary actions.
  - **Intent**: To build trust and communicate quality. It says "this is a serious, well-made product."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Grids**: Feature sections organized in clean, rounded rectangles.
  - **Alternating Rhythm**: Text-Image, Image-Text flow for the story section.
  - **Wide Containers**: Giving content room to breathe, max-width 1200px but with full-bleed backgrounds.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Large Product Renders**: High-res images that you can almost touch.
  - **Subtle Gradients**: Very faint background gradients to add depth without noise.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Consistent border-radius (e.g., 24px) on all cards and buttons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Micro-interactions**: Buttons scale down slightly on click; subtle hover lifts.
  - **Scroll-Triggered**: Elements animate in as they enter the viewport.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax**: Slight parallax on background elements vs foreground images.
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Text lines appearing one after another.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'SF Pro Display' alternative like 'Inter' (Tight tracking, heavy weights).
  - **Body**: 'Inter' (High legibility).
